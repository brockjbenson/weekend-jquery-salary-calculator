## Employee Salary Calculator

# Description

Duration: 

This project is being created to be able to figure out how much we are paying our employees on a monthly basis.
With this app, we will be able to take our employee and some of their information, and add it to a table to see their info in, and to also take their salary. 
We will also be able to see a total of how much we would be paying each employee in the table each month. It is going to show us if the monthly allowance goes over budget ($20,000) by turning it red
